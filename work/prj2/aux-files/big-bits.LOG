This program is a postfix big-bits calculator with operators
'&' for bitwise-and, '|' for bitwise-or and '^' for bitwise-xor.
Literals consist of a '0x' or '0X' prefix followed by one-or-more
hexadecimal characters or underscores (which are ignored).

Postfix allows arbitrary complex bitwise expressions without the
use of parentheses: for example '0xa 0x1 &' denotes the infix
expression '0xa & 0x1' while '0xa 0xb & 0xc 0xd & |' denotes the
infix expression '(0xa & 0xb) | (0xc & 0xd)'.

Input of long literals is facilitated by a repetition feature
which allows a literal to contain a '*' followed by a single
character positive hexadecimal repetition count N; the preceeding
literal string is repeated N times.  For example, '0xa*3' denotes
'0xaaa' and '0xa*3bb*2' denotes '0xaa_abba_aabb'.
