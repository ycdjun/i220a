Created 3 functions:
One of getting bits
One for forming bytes from the bit function and ordering them in big endian as they came in
One for forming words from the byte

Was able to get the invalid character error working

Was not able to get the other two working properly

Unexpected EOF within Byte is partially working as it will not output the full value but it will not output the error statement when the case is true
